# Dockerfile CMD Failure: Missing or Incorrect Start Script

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `CMD` instruction in a Dockerfile. The application fails to start because the specified start script is missing or has an incorrect command.

## Bug

The `package.json` file may not contain a `start` script, or the script may have a typo or point to a non-existent file.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the `package.json` file has a correctly defined `start` script that executes the application correctly. The script should use the correct command and point to a valid entry point of the application.  The script's command should be executable within the container's environment.
